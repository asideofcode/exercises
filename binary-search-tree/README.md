# Exercise: Inventory Management with Binary Search Trees

You are working on a warehouse management system for a company that stores a variety of products with unique IDs in their warehouse. You need to create a system that allows you to quickly search for a product by its ID and update its inventory count.

You decide to use a binary search tree to store the product information, with the product IDs as the keys and the product information as the values. Each node in the tree represents a product with a unique ID and its inventory count.


## Instructions

We have:

1. Defined the `Product` class with `id` and `inventory_count` attributes.

2. Defined the `TreeNode` class with `val` (which in this case will be an instance of the `Product` class), `left` and `right` attributes.

3. Defined the `BinarySearchTree` class with the `root` attribute and thed methods `build_tree`, `search` and `update_inventory` to be implemented by you.

4. Created a test suite that validates the behavior of the code.

Below are the tasks you need to complete:

- [ ] Write a method `build_tree` that takes a list of Product objects and builds a binary search tree where the nodes are sorted in ascending order by their IDs. Note that for any given dataset there can be more than 1 valid binary search trees.
    **Instructions:**

    The `build_tree` method takes a list of Product objects as its argument. The method should iterate through the list and add each product to the binary search tree using storing each product as the `val` attribute of the TreeNode class.

    Your task is to complete the `build_tree` method to create a binary search tree that is sorted in ascending order by the `id` attribute of each product.
    NOTE: We have provided an example implementation of the `build_tree` method called `example_build_tree`, it might be helpful to get you moving.

- [ ] Write a method search that takes a product ID and returns the corresponding node in the binary search tree.

    **Instructions:**

    The search method takes a product ID as its argument. The method should traverse the binary search tree starting from the root node and compare the product ID with the ID of the current node. If the ID matches, the method should return the node. If the product ID is less than the ID of the current node, the method should continue searching in the left subtree of the current node. If the product ID is greater than the ID of the current node, the method should continue searching in the right subtree of the current node. If the search reaches a leaf node without finding a match, the method should return nil.

    Your task is to implement the search method using recursion. The method should return the corresponding node if found, or nil if the product ID is not present in the binary search tree.

- [ ] Write a method `update_inventory` that takes a product ID and updates the inventory count for that product in the binary search tree.

    **Instructions:**

    The `update_inventory` method takes a product ID as its argument. The method should find the node with the corresponding `id` attribute in the binary search tree and update the `inventory_count` attribute of the Product object stored in the `val` attribute of that node.

    Your task is to implement the `update_inventory` method.


## Validate your work

The first step is for you to clone this repository and make sure you can run the unit tests for your language of choice.

1. Clone the repo
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/asideofcode/exercises.git
    ```
2. Change directory into the exercise folder for your language of choice. Below I provide the example of using the `node-js` folder
    ```shell
    cd ./exercises/binary-search-tree/node-js/
    ```
3. Install any dependencies. This depends on the language you decide to use e.g. in the `node-js` folder you must run `npm install` because
    `mocha` is used as the unit test runner in this instance.
4. Run the unit tests. You should see that all the tests are failing, and there will likely be errors telling you that there are methods that have yet to be implemented.
    ```shell
    ./test
    ```

Now you need to modify the source files in order to get the tests passing, as is detailed in the [Instructions](#Instructions) section. For example, in the `node-js` folder you can open the `./inventory-management.js` file and update the `buildTree` function definition on line 29 from:
```js
    buildTree(products) {
        console.error("you must implement buildTree");
    }
```

to:

```js
    buildTree(products) {
        // console.error("you must implement buildTree");
        return this.exampleBuildTree(products)
    }
```

Run the unit tests again
```shell
./test
```

You should see that 1 of the unit tests is now passing, namely `âœ” should build a binary search tree sorted by product ID`. What you did above is implement `buildTree`, albeit using the example implementation provided. You can try to implement it on your own or move on to making the next test pass.

It's a similar exercise for the other languages. Make code changes and validate them running `./test` in the working directory of your language of choice. Without any changes to the source code the tests will fail. Your task is to make all the unit tests pass. Good luck!
